ODDIT (Odd IT jobs)

This project stopped after a while, we moved onto other things. I thought I'd open-source it in case anybody liked the idea.

Most of the functionality is done.

The domain name, oddit.co.nz has since expired.

To use this source, you'll need to know Django, and have some stuff like django-registrations installed.
