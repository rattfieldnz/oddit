ODDIT (Odd IT jobs)

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/LPqr8.png

This project stopped after a while, we moved onto other things. I thought I'd open-source it in case anybody liked the idea.

Most of the functionality is done.

You can find out more at: http://blog.oddit.co.nz

If you want the domain name (oddit.co.nz) let me know.

To use this source, you'll need to know Django, and have some stuff like django-registrations installed.
